CI Placeholders and Policies

This repository runs a minimal CI surface while the implementation stack is still empty.
The placeholder jobs are intentional and must be replaced before any production code ships.

Placeholder controls
- ci/force-fail-build: forces Build to fail
- ci/force-fail-test: forces Test to fail
- ci/force-fail-lint: forces Lint to fail
- ci/force-fail-sast: forces SAST to fail
- ci/force-fail-deps: forces Dependency Scan to fail

Supply-chain posture
- All GitHub Actions are pinned to commit SHA.
- SAST and dependency scan upload SARIF for auditability.

TODO before real code
- Replace placeholder steps with real build/test/lint/tooling.
- Ensure SARIF is generated by actual scanners (not placeholders).
- Update cache strategy and keys to match the chosen build system.
