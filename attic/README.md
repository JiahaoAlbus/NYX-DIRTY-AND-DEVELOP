# Attic (Non‑Production)

This directory contains legacy, reference, and example modules that are **not** part of the production path.

Rules:
- Not executed by CI pipelines.
- Not packaged in release artifacts.
- Kept for historical/reference purposes only.

Authoritative modules live outside `attic/` (see `docs/REPO_TRUTH.md`).
