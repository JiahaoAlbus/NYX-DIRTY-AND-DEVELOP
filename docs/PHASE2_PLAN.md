# Phase-2 Plan (Post Testnet 0.1)

Boundary: protocol core remains sealed; Phase-2 is additive only.

## Phase 1 (Weeks 1–4)
Milestones:
- Public positioning assets and security posture docs
- First upper-layer app skeleton using existing modules
- Conformance-v1 drill expansion and report export

## Phase 2 (Weeks 5–8)
Milestones:
- Developer experience polish for demo tooling and replay
- Audit-focused reporting upgrades and runbook hardening
- Optional demo app variants (profile, note, receipt)

## Phase 3 (Weeks 9–12)
Milestones:
- Ecosystem integrations (protocols and enterprises)
- Operational readiness checklist for pilots
- Freeze and tag for the next testnet milestone
