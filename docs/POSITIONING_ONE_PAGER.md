# NYX Positioning (One Pager)

## 1) What NYX is
NYX is a rule-bound identity protocol with fee enforcement and replayable audit trails.
- Immutable rules against free mutation
- Deterministic end-to-end trace with replay
- Red-team training ground that fails fast on violations

## 2) What NYX is not
- Not a chain
- Not a wallet app
- Not a token narrative

## 3) Who it is for
- Protocol teams that need provable rules
- Application teams that need replayable receipts
- Enterprise or compliance integrators that need auditability

## 4) Why now
- Identity abuse is cheap and common
- Free actions create perverse incentives
- Hidden shortcut paths erode trust
- Auditors need reproducible evidence, not claims

## 5) Core selling points
- Rules that cannot be softened without tripping gates
- Reproducible E2E with trace replay
- Conformance drills that simulate adversarial shortcuts

## 6) Delivered facts (Testnet 0.1)
- End-to-end demo produces replay_ok=True
- Conformance-v1 drills are enforced by CI
- Audit checklist is published and reproducible

## 7) Known boundaries
- Mock prover and stdlib-only stack
- Not a production cryptography promise
- Roadmap remains additive; protocol core stays sealed
